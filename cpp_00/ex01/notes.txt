///
CLASSES
///

A class defines what something is.
An object (an instance of the class) is one actual thing of that type.

    Class = Contact
    Object = 'John' (created from the Contact class)

A class contains:
 - Data (like variables in a C struct)
 - Functions that belong to that data (methods)
 - Access control:
     Private: Only the inside of the class can access
     Public: The outside world can call these functions

----

The header (.hpp) file contains the 'class definition':
 - The variables it contains
 - The public/private sections
 - The method declarations (not the code)
 - Includes

The source (.cpp) file contains the method implementations:
 - The actual code for each method declared in the header

///
CONSTRUCTORS & DECONSTRUCTORS
///

A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
It sets up the initial state of the object.

A destructor is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
It handles cleanup before the object is removed.

    If a constructor / deconstructor is NOT defined, 
    the compiler will generate a default constructor.
        - Safe for types like std::string (they self initialize).
        - Unsafe for 'int', etc. Would contain garbage value.
    
Declared in the public section.
